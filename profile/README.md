# ZenithRP Networks

ZenithRP is a Garrys Mod development group comprised of a community of friends who aim to create unique player-centered experiences and systems in Garrys Mod.
Our goal is to empower players with more control and influence over the virtual world they occupy.

We are currently in the process of developing a custom **Clone Wars RP** server, designed to provide a new and immersive Star Wars experience.
However, as of yet, we do not have a set release date for the server.
